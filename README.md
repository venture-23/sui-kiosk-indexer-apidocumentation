# Welcome to Sui Kiosk Indexer

Kiosk is a decentralized system for commerce applications on Sui. It consists of Kiosks - shared objects owned by individual parties that store assets and allow listing them for sale as well as utilize custom trading functionality - for example, an auction. While being highly decentralized, Kiosk provides a set of strong guarantees:

- Kiosk owners retain ownership of their assets to the moment of purchase.
- Creators set custom policies - sets of rules applied to every trade (such as pay royalty fee or do some arbitrary action X).
- Marketplaces can index events the Kiosk emits and subscribe to a single feed for on-chain asset trading.

Kiosk is a part of the Sui framework, and it is native to the system and available to everyone out of the box.
